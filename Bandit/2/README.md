## Problem Information 
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

## Solution
> `cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename` to return the flag. You can manually identify the spaces with escape sequence characters or just initiate tab completion after typing a few characters as this is the only text file in the home directory, anyways.
